We have the java programm work perfect
the html page looks great
our problem was reading the user input from html to java and print the java output in html file

How to work with the Java input ??
   the java input supposed to take the link generated by html 
   this is how the links looks like
  
     temp=cold&rain=dry&city=medium&skill=c&french=on&english=on
so as input to the java you can choose from the website the desired values then press on button then copy the link from "temp"
will look like that      temp=cold&rain=dry&city=medium&skill=c&french=on&english=on
 then just past it in java and you will get a city as output
